# mapper
a visualization of all the places you've gone

## about
mapper has been a long time coming.
originally concieved early-on in my semester at nyu london,
mapper is a proof of concept for _a visualization of all the places you've gone_.
the development of mapper started on a plane: no wifi, no docs, just code.
created more as an exercise with current front- and back-end web technologies rather than actual, intended use,
mapper presents a simple-but-strong visual interface heavily influenced by brutalism
and flaunts logical-and-dry back-end api routines.

mapper also influenced/inspired two other projects of mine:
[generator-espress](https://github.com/thekelvinliu/generator-espress) and [country-code-emoji](https://github.com/thekelvinliu/country-code-emoji).
as always, feel free to check them out and give feedback :)
the former was used to scaffold mapper.
in fact, one of the major reasons i started working on mapper so long after i thought of it was to work on generator-espress.
the latter is a dependency of mapper, and is used when users upload their location data.

- text wrapping issues
